# ElasticExportGeizhalsDE plugin user guide

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Catalogue export now available for Geizhals
 
Item data can now be exported to Geizhals using a catalogue. You do not need to install a plugin to use the catalogue export. This means that you can <a href="https://knowledge.plentymarkets.com/en-gb/manual/main/markets/geizhals-de.html#catalogue-export" target="_blank">create a catalogue in your plentymarkets system</a> without having to install this plugin.
 
This plugin uses the Elastic Export. Therefore, you also need the **Elastic export** plugin. However, note that no new features are planned for the Elastic Export and the export formats. As such, we recommend that you create catalogues for the item export.
 
Both methods to set up Geizhals in plentymarkets are described in the <a href="https://knowledge.plentymarkets.com/en-gb/manual/main/markets/geizhals-de.html" target="_blank">plentymarkets manual</a>.
